# crtshader-lowend  
fast CRT shader for retroarch, specifically for low resolution displays and low-end devices  
most lower end CRT shaders are very basic, and few look decent on a lower resolution display, so I wrote my own.

example screenshots are:  
* Unfiltered  
* 720p shader  
* 1080p shader + NTSC artifacts  
  
## usage  
update retroarch's shaders  
copy "crt" folder to [retroarch shaders directory]/shaders_slang/ merging it with the existing crt folder
